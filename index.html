We do not tolerate harassment of JazzCon.Tech participants in any form. Please treat your fellow JazzCon.Tech participants with respect, regardless of the context you’re interacting with them.</h4>
           <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Harassment is not appropriate for any conference venue. We expect all JazzCon.Tech participants to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future JazzCon.Tech events, at the discretion of JazzCon.Tech

           Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, sexualized images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Speaker presentations fall under this category and should not use images or examples that would violate the code of conduct.

           JazzCon.Tech participants must remember that JazzCon.Tech organizers and volunteers are not trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement. JazzCon.Tech organizers and volunteers will immediately escalate issues around safety, violence, or similar situations to Cobb Galleria staff or law enforcement.

           For the protection of JazzCon.Tech participants, JazzCon.Tech will never put its organizers or volunteers in the position of trying to assess whether or not an incident merits escalation. If there is any doubt, we will escalate incidents to the appropriate agency immediately.

           Incident Resolution
           • All JazzCon.Tech participants agree to treat each other with respect, regardless of whether you are in a session room or at  the Cobb Galleria facilities.
           • Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals concerned.
           • Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a JazzCon.Tech organizer or volunteer. That person will immediately contact a JazzCon.Tech Board member who has the responsibility to assist in resolution.
           • JazzCon.Tech participants suffering outright assault or extreme harassment should contact the Cobb Galleria staff immediately, or a JazzCon.Tech organizer if they're nearby. That person will immediately escalate the issue to the Cobb Galleria staff or law enforcement as appropriate.

            <h1>Bio-digital jazz, man - how to survive the JavaScript Hype</h1>
            <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
JavaScript was born a very flexible language and in the last years we have become almost too creative with it. Time to check what we have and should use and what not to worry too much about it.

There is a massive confusion about JavaScript happening right now. The pro-JS people see the benefits of creating everything with it and benefit from the control that gives us. At the same time we complicate the build process beyond what any newcomer should go through. The JS critics rightfully point out its flakiness and the issue of legacy environments. Both are right, and both are wrong. Fact is that JavaScript is a massive benefit to the web and allows us to build amazing interfaces. What needs to change is how we approach it.

            <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Progressive Web Apps are the return of the web and the first proper contender to native applications. Take your web products and make them work offline, get notification options and keep them up-to-date without pestering the user.

Web Development has become much more complicated in the last years. We tried to beat the threat of native development and we got lured into thinking our great hardware and connectivity allows us to not worry about performance. We made the web slow and annoying as it was seemingly impossible to beat native apps with open web technologies. Latest changes in the market and a new set of web technologies allows us now to slim down and deliver experiences for our users native environments can not match. In this talk Chris Heilmann of Microsoft shows you how you can be part of this takeover and what it means for our already existing projects.

                    <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
React’s seemingly “magical” features make developing sophisticated web UIs easy by doing so much heavy lifting for us. Unfortunately, without knowing how certain parts of the “magic” work, we run into confusing React warnings/errors.

Why can’t we have “if blocks” in our JSX code? Why do we need to wrap multiple sibling components in a container component? Why do we need to include a “key” attribute on components that are in an array?

In this session geared towards those familiar with React, let’s answer these questions by digging deeper into JSX syntax, virtual DOM diffing and other “magical” features. Not only will we be able to prevent errors with a clearer understanding of the “magic,” but we can potentially boost rendering performance as well.

                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
React just exploded in popularity. But it’s only a UI library, not a full-fledged framework like Angular, Ember or [insert latest JS framework]. We need to create our own “framework” by picking from the plethora of libraries in the React solar system. But which ones should we choose? Or better yet, which ones do we actually need? Do we need a Flux implementation? What about handling ES6+, bundling and routing? How does it all come together?!1?!

Let’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. You’ll get the most out of the session with familiarity with React and its concepts, but you don’t need to be an expert. By the end of the session, you’ll have a solid understanding of the ecosystem, know which libraries you should prioritize learning first, and confidently build your own React-based stack.

                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Functional programming is all the rage these days, but our codebases, libraries, and built-in methods are predominately Object-Oriented. Using OO syntax with functional constructs, we can write in a style compatible with either paradigm and enjoy the benefits of both.
We will explore disjunction, monoids, monads, and other algebraic abstractions to produce highly composable, safer, and simpler code.

The biggest sources of code complexity are state & control flow. Loops, conditionals, try/catch blocks, callbacks, & mutable variable assignment is one way to ensure such complexity. By contrast, if we have a composable set of pieces that plug together, we can “dot chain” a single expression for which our data flows through. We’ll examine techniques from functional programming, borrow some moves from OO, and write blocks of dead-simple to understand code.

                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
You're probably familiar with source maps – they let you debug your original, unminified and untranspiled code in the browser. But ever wonder how they actually work? In this talk, we deep dive into the source map format to see what's under the hood. We'll cover source map generation tools and parsers, and learn how to manipulate source maps directly for fun and profit.
This is a deep dive on source maps. Topics discussed will include:

                    * Intro to source maps + quick history, including basic generation example
                    * How they work in the browser
                    * The latest source map spec (rev3)
                    * How to reverse transform minified code/stack traces using Mozilla's source-map parsing library (https://github.com/mozilla/source-map)
                    * Source maps and Node.js
                    * Source map variants and their tradeoffs (e.g. indexed vs non-indexed)

                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
You have the data, now how do you feed it to a chart so that you can actually see what the data means? In this talk we'll write the code to go from data source to visualization with three different strategies: from a file, from user input (using two-way data binding & from a live data source that's ever-changing. We live in a world with a ridiculous amount of data, let's use it!

The most common source of data is a file. We'll see how simple it is to add that file to your Angular application in order to use that data in a Kendo UI Chart component.

Next, we'll look at how we can get data from user input on a web application. We'll use two-way data binding to take the user input and add it to our charted results. This will be a live demo where attendees will be able to participate.

Finally, we'll look at how we pair a live, ever-changing datasource to our visualization. We'll look at the code to creating a dashboard that keeps us up-to-date with the latest changes in our GitHub repository.

The web is becoming more and more powerful everyday, especially with the launch of Progressive Web Apps. PWAs are experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. You can now build web apps that run from your home screen, receive push notifications & work offline.
We will start by introducing Progressive Web Apps by explaining what are the main concepts behind it (such as Web App Manifest & Service Worker).
We will cover in depth how we can write service worker code to control the network and create resilient experiences.

After introducing PWAs, we will explore relevant best practices.
Last but not least, we will explore some modern Web APIs that will make building PWAs a much more robust experience.

                </h1>
                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Two difficult problems in software development are managing state and side effects. Spread state out among components or consolidate it? Bidirectional or unidirectional data flow? How to test API calls or handle asynchronous events? Redux is a simple but powerful library that wrangles state and makes it easier to reason about and update in a unidirectional manner. Redux Saga is a library built upon ES2015 generator functions that makes managing application side effects a breeze with Redux. In this talk, dive into these two technologies and discover how useful they are for building applications in a more testable and deterministic manner. Explore the Redux architecture, including stores, reducers, actions, and middleware. Learn about JavaScript generator functions and how to declaratively manage side effects with Redux Saga. Say goodbye to mocks and spies and see how easy it is to test API calls and asynchronous events. Finally, express more complex constructs such as barrier synchronization and background tasks with Redux Saga's declarative operators. Leave this talk prepared to create cleaner, more testable code for managing state and side effects.                </div>

                <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. Elm empowers front-end developers with the benefits of functional programming and type safety to build applications that are easy to reason about and have no runtime exceptions. Elm encourages describing UI, state, and events in a declarative manner, while performing as good as or better than the current JavaScript framework hotness. In this workshop, learn about functional programming and its many benefits while diving into the Elm language. Leave this workshop with a better understanding of functional programming and the knowledge to construct non-trivial applications with better code and determinism.

This workshop will explore the basics of functional programming as well as more advanced topics. We will cover topics such as purity, closures, declarative programming, immutability, recursion, currying, and the big "M" word, monads.

After learning about functional programming, we will explore Elm's architecture more thoroughly. We will discover the model-view-update pattern along with unidirectional data flow. We will learn how we can write pure functions to describe our application UI with composable views and side effects with commands and subscriptions.

Finally, equipped with our newfound knowledge of functional programming and Elm, we will build an application that incorporates all the topics we covered and see how they yield an application with better determinism, safety, and no runtime exceptions.
